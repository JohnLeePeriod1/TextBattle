********** NOTE ***********
For the grader, no code is posted here for the text battle project as 
the master schedule asserts that the project is not due tonight, but next next tuesday (2/28).
Also, since I was gone in NY for a week, I have a two-day extension until Sunday Mid-night, 
in case the project is indeed due Friday mid-night.
If the project is indeed due 2/17/17 mid-night, please check back sunday mid-night and please leave a note that the project's schedule
has not been altered.
